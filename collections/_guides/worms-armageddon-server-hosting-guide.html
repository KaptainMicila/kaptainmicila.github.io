<h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
<p>
    Some friends of mine, after playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_Armageddon">Worms
        Armageddon</a> together, wanted to play Worms by themself, and
    wanted to know how to host a game server outside of their
    <del>LANs</del>
    homes.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning d-flex align-items-center border my-2" role="alert">
    <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-2x me-2"></i>
    <div>
        <p class="mb-2">
            Did I seriously create a whole site just to write to your friends how to host a Worms game?
        </p>
        <p>
            Yeah. Making a site it's not hard at all.

<h2 class="mt-4">PART 1: THE IP ADDRESS</h2>
<h3>THE EASY WAY</h3>
<p>
    Just open one of the many services available on the internet (just google it or something), and search for your
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4">IPv4 address</a>!
</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger d-flex align-items-center border my-2" role="alert">
    <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x me-2"></i>
    <div>
        <p class="mb-2">
            It's suggested to NOT share this address with anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            But you're playing with people you <em>probably</em> trust, so it's ok.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<h3 class="mt-3">THE <strong>HARD</strong> WAY</h3>
<p>
    As the way it's not the same for all routers I'll not be writing it.
</p>
<p>
    You'll have to check how to get your external IPv4 address from your router's model by yourself.
</p>
<h2 class="mt-4">PART 3: PORT FORWARDING</h2>
<p class="mb-2">
    You're lucky, Worms Armageddon has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play">UPNP</a>,
    (that means it's automatic).
</p>
<p>
    If you want (or have to) do it manually, it's, <em>sadly</em>, another thing that you will
    have to search for yourself (thanks, router makers).
</p>
<h2 class="mt-4">PART 4: HOSTING THE GAME</h2>
<ol start="1">
    <li>Click the bottom left box</li>
    <li>Input your name in the <kbd>Player Information</kbd> area</li>
    <li>Click the top left box</li>
    <li>In the bottom right box, input the server's name and password</li>
    <li>Click <kbd>Host</kbd></li>
    <li>???</li>
    <li>Profit.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="mt-4">PART EXTRA: JOINING THE GAME</h2>
<h3>If you're in the same network</h3>
<p>
    In step 4's window, you'll be able to see your friend's server in the top left box
</p>
<h3 class="mt-3">If you're in different networks</h3>
<p>
    In step 1-2's window, you'll have to type your friend's external IP in the bottom input form
